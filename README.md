# zbx-templates-repository
We'll be placing some ZABBIX templates onto this repo that we're developing for our own use but might be also useful for 
the community. We expect to get them as close to perfection as possible (off course) with aid from the community we'll 
surely get them to a level of perfectionism which will at the end of the day reduce and/or prevent situations 
(in our networks) to turn into problems
